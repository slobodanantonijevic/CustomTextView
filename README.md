## CustomTextView ##
An android lib that (for now only) enables adding a custom font from XML layout

Plans exist to further enhance this library, but that'll happen when there's more spare time :)

Please read the guide and if in doubt do not hesitate to fire the question

Please do check the Example app provided in this repository if you have any doubts on how to use the lib, and also if you have any suggestions.

## Adding to project ##

### Sdk Version ###
`compileSdkVersion` >= 25

### Importing to project ###

#### Example for Gradle: ####

Step 1. Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```groovy
allprojects {
	repositories {
		...
		maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}
```

Step 2. Add the dependency
```groovy
compile 'com.github.slobodanantonijevic:CustomTextView:1.0.1'
```

## Getting started ##

Adding a font .ttf to your project in
```groovy
assets/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.ttf
```

### Adding a custom widget in `xml` ###
First make sure you import namespace for custom views in your layout's root view, eg:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<LinearLayout
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:custom="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:gravity="center"
    android:orientation="vertical">

...

</LinearLAyout>
```
Then you can use fontTypeFaceAsset in your CustomTextView:
```xml
<com.slobodanantonijevic.widget.CustomTextView
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:textSize="25.0sp"
        custom:fontTypeFaceAsset="fontawesome-webfont.ttf"
        android:text="@string/fa_font" />
```

Enjoy :D
